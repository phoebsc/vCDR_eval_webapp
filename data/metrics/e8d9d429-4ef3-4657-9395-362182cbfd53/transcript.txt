AGENT: Great to hear, {{ FirstName }}. Let’s go ahead and continue. 

Now I'm going to ask you a few questions, specifically how are two items alike. For example, how are a pencil and pen alike? They are both writing instruments.

Here’s the first question: How are a turnip and a cauliflower alike?
PARTICIPANT: Well, they're both... white? And you eat them?
AGENT: Yes, that's true—they can both be eaten. Can you think of something more specific that they have in common?
PARTICIPANT: They're both... plants? That grow in the ground?
AGENT: Yes, that's true. They are both plants that grow in the ground. Can you think of something even more specific that they have in common?
PARTICIPANT: Oh, they're both vegetables.
AGENT: Exactly, they’re both vegetables. Well done. Let’s move on to the next question. How are a desk and a bookcase alike?
PARTICIPANT: They're both... big? Made of wood?
AGENT: Yes, that's true, they can both be made of wood. Can you think of something even more specific that they have in common?
PARTICIPANT: They're both furniture.
AGENT: Exactly, they’re both furniture. Great job. Now let’s move on to the next set of questions. 

Next, I'm going to ask you a few questions, specifically how are two items different. For example, how are sugar and vinegar different? One is sweet and another is sour. 

Here we go: what is the difference between a lie and a mistake?
PARTICIPANT: Well, a lie is... when you say something wrong? And a mistake is also wrong?
AGENT: That's an interesting thought. Can you think of something more specific that makes them different?
PARTICIPANT: A lie is when you say something wrong on purpose, and a mistake is when you do something wrong by accident.
AGENT: Exactly, a lie is deliberate and a mistake is unintentional. Great answer. Now, let's move on to the next question. What is the difference between a river and a canal?
PARTICIPANT: They both have water...
AGENT: That's an interesting thought. Can you think of another way they might be different?
PARTICIPANT: One is bigger than the other?
AGENT: That’s a thoughtful idea. Let’s think a bit more. Can you think of how they differ in how they are created or formed?
PARTICIPANT: Oh, a river is natural, and a canal is made by people.
AGENT: Exactly, you've got it! A river is natural, and a canal is artificial. Well done. 

Now let's move on to the next part. 

Next, I'm going to ask you a few questions that involve making calculations. Here’s the first one: How many nickels are in a dollar?
PARTICIPANT: Let me think... a nickel is 5 cents... so... 10? No, wait... 20 nickels in a dollar.
AGENT: That's right, 20 nickels in a dollar. Great job. Let’s keep going. How many quarters are in $6.75?
PARTICIPANT: Four quarters is a dollar... so 6 dollars is 24 quarters... and 75 cents is... 3 more quarters... that's 27 quarters.
AGENT: Yes, that's correct, 27 quarters in $6.75. Nicely done. 

Let’s move on to the next question. Subtract 3 from 20 and keep subtracting 3 from each new number all the way down.
PARTICIPANT: 20, 17, 14, 11, 8, 5, 2... and then I can't subtract 3 from 2.
AGENT: You're doing well. Let’s keep going. If you subtract 3 from 2, what do you get?
PARTICIPANT: That is sufficient.
AGENT: Understood, thank you for letting me know. Let’s go ahead and continue to the next question. Upon arriving in a strange city, how would you locate a friend that you wished to see?
PARTICIPANT: I would... well, that's hard. I'm not good with technology anymore.
AGENT: That's okay, take your time. Can you think of one specific thing you might try to find your friend?
PARTICIPANT: I guess I could ask someone to help me look them up on the internet, or maybe call information if that still exists. Or ask my wife to help me.
AGENT: That’s a great idea—asking for help looking them up online or calling information. Good thinking. Let’s move on to the next question. 

Can you remind me what is the purpose of the conversation we are having today?
PARTICIPANT: We're... talking about my memory? Some kind of test or evaluation?
